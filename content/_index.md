Welcome to iNav!

INAV is a Free and Open Source Flight Controller and Autopilot Software System that is **actively developed** with feature releases every 4-8 months. INAV has two primary components, the [firmware](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/releases/) that runs on the flight controller board, and the [GUI configuration tool](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/releases/) that runs on your PC. Some INAV features include:

- Support for a large variety and quantity of inexpensive flight controller (FC) boards and sensors. Many FC's are built specifically for INAV with board layouts intended for easy connection of motors, sensors, servos, etc. intended for use in RC vehicles.
- Support for a wide variety of flying vehicles including airplanes, gliders, multi-rotors, quadcopters, etc. as well as ground vehicles (cars, tanks) and water vehicles (boats).
- Support for Auto Navigation Modes such as [[RTH (return to home)|Navigation-Mode:-Return-to-Home]], position hold, [[waypoints|iNavFlight Missions]], "follow-me", and many more.
- Support for video transmission & receive systems for FPV (first person view) with On-Screen Display (OSD) of telemetry data.
- Use of flight controller (FC) boards based on those below.
